# Angular-Calendar-Widget
A calendar widget created in angularJS
I realized that there isn't proper calendar controls on the web for angular JS (available as freeware), apart from angular ui bootstrap 
which has a dependency on bootstrap.css and its related js file. Since I did not want to download the whole bootstrap package for just a few 
controls I decided to create one by myself. This is only a calendar and not a datepicker control. It is very eailsly customizable and please 
provide as mucj feedback so that I can improve this widget.
