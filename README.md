# Angular-Calendar-Widget 
A calendar widget created in angularJS - 
I realized that there isn't a proper calendar control on the web for angular JS (available as freeware), apart from angular ui bootstrap
which has a dependency on bootstrap.css and its related js file. 

Since I did not want to download the whole bootstrap package for just a few controls I decided to create one by myself. This is only a calendar and not a datepicker control. It is very easily customizable. Feedbacks are appreciated.
